          <h3>Narrative</h3>
          <p class="reference-intro">
            We stitched together SCADA pulls, billing data, and feeder surveys to pinpoint where energy was disappearing. That
            mapping revealed a handful of high-loss clusters that were dragging down collections, so investment focused on
            replacing weak spans, tightening protection schemes, and proving to customers that reliability was improving.
          </p>
          <p>
            Parallel tariff modelling introduced a glidepath that paired loss cuts with gradual revenue recovery. Each step was
            stress-tested against household affordability, social-tariff coverage, and lender covenants so the regulator could
            back reforms without overloading customers already facing high inflation.
          </p>

          <h3>Approach</h3>
          <p>
            A joint taskforce co-designed revenue protection pilots, combined SCADA data with field inspections, and published a
            transparent dashboard for the board and regulator. The mix of field crews and analysts built confidence in the loss
            estimates, prioritised feeder-by-feeder investments, and set milestones lenders could monitor alongside the utility.
