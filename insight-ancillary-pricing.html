          <h3>Why pricing is shifting</h3>
          <p>
            Ancillary markets are moving from static reserve products to faster, verifiable services. Operators now reward measured response speed and availability, pushing flexibility providers to prove performance rather than rely on nameplate capacity. That mirrors what PJM, ERCOT, and South African pilots have shown: buyers pay for provable flexibility, not promises.
          </p>

          <h3>Design signals to watch</h3>
          <p>
            Procurement rules are tightening telemetry standards and assigning ramping obligations that reflect the physics of each system. Hydro, gas, and batteries can all win, but each needs clear testing windows, dispatch prioritisation, and penalty regimes aligned to response quality. Markets are also experimenting with locational adders where congestion or inertia is thin, making grid-forming capabilities financially visible.
          </p>

          <h3>Practical toolkit</h3>
          <p>
            Advisory teams should walk operators through simplified response tests, settlement templates that separate availability from delivery, and revenue stacks that blend reserve, energy, and redispatch opportunities without double counting. A one-page playbook showing how telemetry, testing, and settlements fit together keeps bidders confident that obligations will be enforced fairly.
          </p>

          <h3>Implementation watch-outs</h3>
          <p>
            Data lineage matters: logging droop curves, frequency events, and metered response in one place keeps disputes low and investor confidence high. Training system operators to interpret the data is as important as drafting the contracts, and it ensures post-event audits reward genuine flexibility rather than creative scheduling.
