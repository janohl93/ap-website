          <h3>Build a single source of truth</h3>
          <p>
            Every scenario, dataset, and tweak needs a changelog. Simple markdown notes and versioned data folders make it easy
            to explain why a conclusion holds even when assumptions move. When multiple regulators review the same study, they
            can see which assumptions are harmonised and which are bespoke.
          </p>

          <h3>Test what matters</h3>
          <p>
            Automatic checks on load data, renewable traces, and dispatch outputs catch the errors that derail credibility. The
            tests do not need to be complex; they simply need to run every time a workbook or script changes. Think of them as
            pre-flight checks for analytics, catching silent unit errors before they show up in board slides.
          </p>

          <h3>Leave an audit trail</h3>
          <p>
            Annotate charts and model outputs with sources and timestamps so regulators and lenders can retrace each decision.
            When cross-border flows or tariffs are at stake, that trail removes hours of negotiation friction and builds a
            reusable library of defensible visuals.
          </p>

          <h3>Share the playbook</h3>
          <p>
            Publish a short README with file locations, contact points, and rerun instructions. Teams that onboard quickly win
            more work because clients see less risk in handing over sensitive data, and new analysts spend hours instead of days
            finding the right scripts.
